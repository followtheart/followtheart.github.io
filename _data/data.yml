    title: Biography
    summary: |
      Currently I am a M.Sc. candidate of the
      [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn)
      in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) and a member of the
      [LAMDA Group](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn), lead by Professor
      [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh).
      
      I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology from
      [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) in June 2018.
      In the same year, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in
      Computer Science and Technology in
      [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) without entrance examination.
      
      I am interested in machine learning and data mining.
      Currently, I am focusing on deep learning for speech and computer vision.
